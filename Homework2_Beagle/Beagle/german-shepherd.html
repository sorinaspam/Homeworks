        The German Shepherd, also known in Britain as an Alsatian, is a German
        breed of working dog of medium to large size. The breed was developed by
        Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from
        1899. It was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has
        since been used in many other types of work, including disability
        assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly
        kept as a companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique
        Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in
        2013.
