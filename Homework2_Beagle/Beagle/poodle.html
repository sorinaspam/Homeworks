        The Poodle likely originated in Germany, although the Fédération
        Cynologique Internationale (FCI) and a minority of cynologists believe
        it originated in France. Similar dogs date back to at least the 17th
        century. Larger Poodles were originally used by wildfowl hunters to
        retrieve game from water, while smaller varieties were once commonly
        used as circus performers. Poodles were recognized by both the Kennel
        Club of the United Kingdom and the American Kennel Club (AKC) soon after
        the clubs' founding. Since the mid-20th century, Poodles have enjoyed
        enormous popularity as pets and show dogs – Poodles were the AKC's most
        registered breed from 1960 to 1982, and are now the FCI's third most
        registered breed. Poodles are also common at dog shows, where they often
        sport the popularly recognized Continental clip, with face and rear
        clipped close, and tufts of hair on the hocks and tail tip.
